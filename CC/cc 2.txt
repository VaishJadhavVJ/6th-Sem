THEORY TO WRITE:

INTRDUCTION:
Google App Engine (GAE) is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering by Google that allows developers to build and deploy applications on Google's infrastructure. Here are the main points about Google App Engine:
GAE provides a fully managed platform for developing and hosting web applications, taking care of infrastructure management, scaling, and system administration tasks.
It supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, Node.js, Go, and more.
GAE offers automatic scaling and load balancing, ensuring that your application can handle varying traffic and scale seamlessly.
It provides built-in security features, including access control, firewall rules, and secure data storage options.
GAE integrates with other Google Cloud services, allowing you to leverage additional functionality like databases, storage, and machine learning.
Developing applications on GAE follows a serverless model, where you only pay for the resources your application consumes.
GAE offers development tools and SDKs to streamline the development and deployment process.
Steps to create a project and application on Google App Engine:

STEPS TO CREATE PROJECT:
Sign in to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) using your Google account.
Create a new project in the Cloud Console, providing a name and project ID.
Enable the App Engine service for your project.
Install the necessary development tools, such as the Cloud SDK and App Engine SDK, on your local machine.
Develop your application code using the supported programming language and frameworks.
Configure your application by defining the app.yaml file, specifying runtime environment, scaling settings, and other parameters.
Test your application locally using the development server provided by the App Engine SDK.
Deploy your application to the App Engine by using the gcloud command-line tool or Cloud Console UI.
Monitor and manage your application's performance, logs, and traffic using the Cloud Console.
