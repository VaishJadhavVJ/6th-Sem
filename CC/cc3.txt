INTRODUCTION:
Apex is a proprietary programming language developed by Salesforce.com specifically for building applications on the Salesforce platform. Here's a brief explanation:
- Apex is an object-oriented, strongly typed language similar to Java. It allows developers to customize and extend Salesforce applications with business logic and workflows.
- It runs on the Salesforce platform, which provides infrastructure, security, data management, and user interface components, making it a powerful tool for building enterprise applications.
- Apex code can be written directly in the Salesforce Developer Console or in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code.
- It supports various features such as classes, interfaces, triggers, batch processing, web services, and database operations.
- Apex code can interact with Salesforce data using SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) to query and manipulate records in the Salesforce database.
- It also integrates seamlessly with other Salesforce tools and technologies, such as Lightning Components, Visualforce pages, and Salesforce APIs.

To create an application in Salesforce using Apex, you would typically follow these steps:
1. Define the data model: Identify the objects and fields required for your application and create them using the Salesforce Object Manager.
2. Write Apex classes and triggers: Define the business logic and behavior of your application by writing Apex classes and triggers. These classes can handle data manipulation, perform calculations, and enforce custom validation rules.
3. Create Visualforce pages or Lightning Components: Build the user interface for your application using Visualforce pages or Lightning Components. These components define the layout and functionality that users interact with.
4. Implement security and access controls: Set up security settings and permissions to control data access and define user roles and profiles. Apex code can be used to enforce additional custom security rules.
5. Test and debug: Write unit tests to validate the functionality of your Apex code. Salesforce provides tools for testing and debugging Apex code, ensuring that your application behaves as expected.
Here's an example of a simple Apex class that retrieves and updates a record in Salesforce:

```java
public class AccountUpdater {
    public static void updateAccount(String accountId, String newStatus) {
        Account acc = [SELECT Id, Name, Status__c FROM Account WHERE Id = :accountId];
        acc.Status__c = newStatus;
        update acc;
    }
}
```

This code defines a class named `AccountUpdater` with a static method `updateAccount()`. It takes an account ID and a new status as parameters, retrieves the account record using a SOQL query, updates the `Status__c` field, and then saves the changes using the `update` statement.

By leveraging Apex and the Salesforce platform, developers can create powerful and customized applications that meet specific business requirements within the Salesforce ecosystem.


LINEAR SEARCH PROGRAM: 
public class linearSearch {
    public static void main(Integer key){
    	System.debug('Linear Search');
    	integer s = -1;
    	List<integer> lon = new List<integer> ();
    	lon.add(3);
    	lon.add(4);
    	lon.add(5);
    	lon.add(6);
    	System.debug('List: '+lon);
    	for(integer i = 0; i < lon.size(); i++)
    	{
        	if (key == lon[i])
        	{
            	s = 1;
        	}
    	}
    	if (s == 1)
    	{
        		System.debug('Element Found');
    	}
    	else
    	{
        		System.debug('Element Not Found');
    	}
	}
}
